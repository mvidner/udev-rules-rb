* Udev Rules in yast-network

https://github.com/yast/yast-network

** What are Udev Rules

If a computer has two network cards, how does it determine which one is *eth0*
and which one is *eth1*?

A Linux machine may have several network interfaces, such as eth0, eth1,
wlan0, enp0s3.
These udev rules ensure the correct assignment of interface names.

_(
  "<p><b>Udev Rules</b> are rules for the kernel device manager that allow\n" \
    "associating the MAC address or BusID of the network device with its name (for\n" \
    "example, eth1, wlan0 ) and assures a persistent device name upon reboot.\n"
)

For a NIC a widget exists where you can change its name and choose whether it
will be pinned to its MAC (Ethernet address), or its PCI bus address.

** Why

The code of yast-network is messy, so Udev Rules is one area to clean it up.
It is simple enough and well defined.

** Plan

[x] collect all mentions of "udev" in yast-network
[ ] read them all and design a decent API
[ ] cover the code with tests
[ ] use the new API, possibly using old code underneath
[ ] replace old implementation with a better one

** AY interface

The rnc schema says all elements are optional
but the SLE12(also 15) docs says name+rule+value are all required

https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/singlehtml/book_autoyast/book_autoyast.html#CreateProfile.Network.names

Semantics: the device *name* is identified
by the field with the key *rule* (sic!) having the value *value*
(that does not allow some complex identifications)

** Areas NOT in scope

These are related to Udev in the current code but let's not touch them
in this 1st stage.

*** s390 rules (AY: networking/s390-devices)

are similar but not really
- set up a virtual device
- do not include a name(!?)
*** driver rules (selecting the driver seems broken?)
the other part of ag_udev_persistent
not part of AY?

** API
*** Naming

Anything named "udev" should be code-clean.

LanItems - keep it for now but remember that "item" is too generic
  yet it combines info about a "nic" and its (stored) config.

"Udev" is an implementation detail, the upper layer should say
"NameRule"

"Udev name" -> "device name", or "persistent device name"

In LanItems, keep the general interface of item["udev"]["net"]
so that existing code works, BUT
  instead of ["net"] which is_a Array<String>
  make       ["name_rule"] which is_a NameRule

*** copying and identity
#Items are deeply copied values? NO. GetLanItem and getCurrentItem return the
original data.

*** LanItems item API

This is strictly speaking above our area of focus, but the current naming is
so awful that at least a glossary is needed to be able to understand what's
going on.

**** current -> Integer
the *index* of the current item
**** GetLanItem(item_id) => item(item_id) # surprisingly no collisions with "item" lvar
**** getCurrentItem      => current_item
**** item_name_rule(item_id) = item(item_id)["udev"]["name_rule"]
also considering that #item would be an adaptor object
that would translate #name_rule to ["udev"]["name_rule"]
Does it need to exist? Nil? NullRule?
**** current_item_name_rule  =  current_item["udev"]["name_rule"]

*** target API
This is a sketch of the new API as emerging from the Usage section below
**** NameRule
***** @udev [UdevRule]
***** #matcher= and #matcher(:bus_id or :mac)
***** #value (case sensitive??)
***** #name
udev["NAME"]
**** NameRules
***** #pathname
"/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules"

*** Usage
Here I list all the mentions of "udev" in the code
and sketch out how to write them better.
**** InstallInfConvertor
***** AllowUdevModify
checks if cmdline contains "biosdevname=..."
**** NetworkLanComplexInclude src/include/network/lan/complex.rb
***** calls LanItems.update_item_udev_rule!(:bus_id)
**** Lan#Export
calls LanItems#Export
**** lan_auto
***** ToAY converts the net-udev piece from a hash to an array
**** NetworkLanHardwareInclude
it's the Hardware tab
      device_name = LanItems.current_udev_name
let's keep that
**** save_network
#copy_udev_rules

s390 51* leave that

the rule file needs to be copied from inst-sys to target:
  need its fs path
  NameRules#pathname (and use std ruby dirname+basename)
BTW the https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=293366#c7 comment means
a mkdir -p is fine
**** edit_nic_name EditNicName
is a freshly rewritten class, yay 2013-09 mchf
well, it is called like EditNicName.new.run
and its #initialize uses the ugly LanItemsApi
so does #run
and #CheckUdevNicName (sic)
***** to be removed:
MAC_UDEV_ATTR   = "ATTR{address}".freeze
BUSID_UDEV_ATTR = "KERNELS".freeze
***** initialize
@old_key = current_item_name_rule.matcher
***** run
        LanItems.update_item_udev_rule!(udev_type)
(watch out, uses the ui symbol directly)
***** CheckUdevNicName
uses LanItems#GetCurrentName
  which is GetDeviceName(@current) ... and it never uses the "udev name" which
  confuses my naming plan :(
renamed! to check_new_device_name
**** network_autoyast
renaming logic
***** create_udevs
"# Creates udev rules according definition from profile"
rename to create_name_rules_from_profile
uses LanItems.createUdevFromIfaceName - well drop that, SLE10 compat
calls assign_udevs_to_devs
***** assign_udevs_to_devs (udev_rules: Array<AY_rule>)
  make nr = NameRule.from_ay(hash(name rule value))
  it's a standalone one not part of NameRules
  does an item match a NameRule

  rename_lan_item
***** rename_lan_item
keep the signature because the renaming mess is fragile and we'll leave the
  logic unchanged for now

  LanItems.InitItemUdevRule(item_idx) # the only caller
**** LanItems
***** #current_udev_name
deals with renaming, uses
         LanItems.GetItemUdev("NAME")
-> current_item_name_rule.name
def current_item_name_rule; current_item["udev"]["name_rule"] + autovivify(?); end
***** LanItems#update_item_udev_rule!(:mac or :bus_id)
  implementation eventually does
          Items()[@current]["udev"]["net"] = new_rule

  LanItems.current is the *index*, duh

so:
  current_item_name_rule.matcher = :bus_id   # maybe make/use an Enum class? but a symbol is ok
  # saving semantics?

***** LanItems#export
should produce the net-udev part for Export

export_s390_devices
export_net_udev
 (warning, on s390 it constructs KERNELS rules detected from /sys
  probably keep the weird impl)

NameRule#to_ay ->
 { "rule" => "KERNELS", "name" => "eth1", "value" => "0000:00:1f.6" }
NameRules#to_ay ->
 an array of (NameRule#to_ay)
 (NOTE that LanItems#export needs a [name, rule]...to_h conversion until the
 ToAY conversion is dropped)
***** createUdevFromIfaceName
rename to name_rules_from_sle10_names
or just drop it quietly
make implicitly defined rules via old style names
  ifcfg-eth-id-nn-nn-nn...
  ifcfg-eth-bus-nnnn-nn...
***** InitItemUdevRule
***** GetItemUdevRule(item_id) -> Array<String> rule
       Ops.get_list(GetLanItem(itemId), ["udev", "net"], [])
  =>
  item_name_rule(item_id) -> NameRule
